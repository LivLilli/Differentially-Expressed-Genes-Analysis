In this repository, I made an analysis over the differentially expressed genes, i.e. the genes whose expressions changes significantly passing from a normal to a tumor condition.

In particular, here there are the 3 tasks:

* Step 1:
> Compute co-expression network using Fold-Change values;


* Step 2:
> Compare hubs sets related to the use of different centrality measures;


* Step 3:
> Only considering degree index, are the hubs up or down regulated?


## Repository description

* <i>lab_DE.ipynb</i>: 
> a notebook with the code.

* <i>THCA_GeneExpressionData.xlsx</i>: 
> excel file with our data;

* <i>betweenness_centrality.txt</i>: 
> txt file generated by the code, with computed centrality measures.
